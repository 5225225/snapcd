# Crypto

Servers should not be able to know what data they are storing.

Each repository has a 32 byte repo key, which is used to encrypt all data. This
is mandatory. Repos that are public can use a key of all zeros. This is done to
ensure that the cryptography code is always run, instead of being an edge case
that no one cares about.

Data can be deduplicated amongst repos that have the same key, therefore using
encryption does not harm deduplication.

From the repo key, we use blake3 derive_key with a context of "snapcd <commit
timestamp of implementation> encryption key" as well as the same but with
"identification key".

Let these be EKey and IKey respectively.

We also need a 64 byte*256 table for gearhash. Derive this.

# From file to server

Let's assume you already have the repo key (RKey) and want to upload a file.

Derive your custom table for gearhash, and chunk the file into chunks with it.

Take the chunk you have, and hash it with a keyed blake3 using IKey.

You now have a hash for this object. This hash is what's public, and is sent to
the server, as well as being stored permanently in your objects.

Use a libsodium secretbox (xsalsa20 poly1305) and use your EKey to encrypt the
data with a random nonce.

Now that it's encrypted, we can send this (along with the hash!) to the server.

# and back...

Let's say we want to download a chunk from the server, where we know the hash.

Well, we just ask the server for the file with said hash.

Once we get that, we use our EKey to decrypt it. Any server tampering or
corruption will be detected here.

Once we get that, we might as well verify that the data is what we expect
(Maybe there's a buggy client?). Take your blob of data, and hash it with a
keyed blake3 just like you did to generate the hash in the first place.

If there's a mismatch *here*, then you have a bad client.

> If there's a mismatch here, then you need to delete the object from the server and re-get it, somehow. 

# reflog

Unlike in git, the mapping from branch name to commit id is done through an actual log.

The details of this ~~are~~ will be detailed in reflog.md, but here I'll spec out the crypto here.

It's an append only log of packets. Each packet is encrypted similary to above, using the same algorithm.

TODO: does this need to use a different key?
