multiple ways to show a commit, in order of shortest to longest


1. single line (Show commit hash, and then first line of message)
    --oneline

2. multi line (Show commit hash, and full message, as well as metadata)
    --full

3. stat (The above, but also a list of changes between it and the child)
    --stat

4. diff (Multi line, but a full text diff of contents)
    --diff

All of the above should also be supported when showing a log


Showing a directory: shows children names, no configuration.

Showing a file/blobtree/blob: Shows contents


`snapcd show <object>`

`snapcd log <commit>`


Format:
